# Lane-Detection-Using-Image-Processing
We did a project on "Curve Lane Detection Using Canny Edge Detection &amp; Hough Transformation" in Image Processing course (CSE428).

The research conducted by our project provides better image contrast by application of CLAHE along with precise curved lane detection by using the Hough Transformation. The Hough Transformation is a technique which can be used to isolate features of a particular shape within an image, analyzing image using CV and digital image processing.
